🏢 Employee Management System (Java)
📘 Overview

The Employee Management System (EMS) is a console-based Java application that allows users to manage both Full-Time and Part-Time Employees.
It demonstrates the power of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as Inheritance, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism, providing a clean and modular design for employee data handling.

⚙️ Features
👷 Part-Time Employee Module

Add part-time employee details (name, ID, working hours, and pay per hour)

Calculate total salary automatically based on hours worked

Display all part-time employees with salary information

💼 Full-Time Employee Module

Add full-time employee details (name, ID, and fixed salary)

Display all full-time employees with salary details

🚪 Exit Option

Gracefully terminates the program when the user chooses to exit

🧠 OOP Concepts Used
Concept	Description
Inheritance	parttimeemployee and fulltimeemployee inherit from the base class employee
Encapsulation	Employee data is organized within objects and accessed via class methods
